"""L1 correctness for the torchTLX ``mm`` provider.

- TLX.ops evaluates only the TLX template (torchTLX ``force`` mode) using the
  heuristic config path
- TLX.ops passes numerical tests of all shapes

This framework is fixed. A shape the torchTLX path cannot run goes in
``FAILED_SHAPES`` with a one-line TODO -- not a new test, not a skip.
