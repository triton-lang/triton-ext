"""Which GPU are we generating for?

Detection and resolution only -- the hardware facts themselves live in the arch
classes in :mod:`.resources`. Every architecture query in the torchTLX Inductor
integration goes through here rather than a fresh ``torch.version.hip`` /
``gcnArchName`` sniff at the call site.

Arch ids follow the vocabulary in ``triton._internal_testing`` -- capability
strings on NVIDIA (``sm90``, ``sm100``, ``sm107``) and gfx names on AMD
(``gfx942``, ``gfx950``, ``gfx1250``) -- so the two agree on what "the same
target" means. Note the ordering hazard that module documents: ``gfx1250`` must
be matched before any ``gfx12`` prefix rule, or an RDNA4 check swallows it.

Two entry points, deliberately split by cost:

- :func:`is_rocm` only reads ``torch.version.hip``. It is safe at import time
  (heuristic registration needs it) and never initializes a CUDA context.
- :func:`current_target` queries the device, cached and lazy. With no GPU
  visible it reports no arch at all, so a build host can never be mistaken for
  real hardware; see :data:`REFERENCE_ARCH`.
